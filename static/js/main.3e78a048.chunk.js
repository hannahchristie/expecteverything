Their whole culture is reshaped around this difference: their notion of beauty depends on the feel rather than the look of a face; no windows adorn their houses; they work at night, when it is cool, and sleep during the day, when it is hot. A mountain climber named Nunez stumbles upon this community and hopes that he will rule over it: \u201cIn the Country of the Blind the One-Eyed Man is King,\u201d he repeats to himself. Yet he comes to find that his ability to see is not an asset but a burden. The houses are pitch-black inside, and he loses fights to local warriors who possess extraordinary senses of touch and hearing. The blind live with no knowledge of the sense of sight, and no need for it. They consider Nunez\u2019s eyes to be diseased, and mock his love for a beautiful woman whose face feels unattractive to them. When he finally fails to defeat them, exhausted and beaten, he gives himself up. They ask him if he still thinks he can see: \u201cNo,\u201d he replies, \u201cThat was folly. The word means nothing \u2014 less than nothing!\u201d They enslave him because of his apparently subhuman disability. But when they propose to remove his eyes to make him \u201cnormal,\u201d he realizes the beauty of the mountains, the snow, the trees, the lines in the rocks, and the crispness of the sky \u2014 and he climbs a mountain, attempting to escape.")),r.a.createElement("p",null,"In the world described above the man with sight is the one who is different and as a result he encounters barriers to his normal functioning in society.
